## Introduction

You are living. You have a life. There is only one you can feel and experience as a life. Is it enough? Have you feel any regret that you should have selected another option before? Yes, I have. Here is my imagination that you can play multi-stories on the board where another "you" are living.

## Life Game

Now that you can start your new virtual life. This field looks like a board game, where you can proceed your history according to your dice you shake. When you stop a square, an event written there might be happen. Some one is great, which you can feel as if you are successful in that moment, but the other is worse, which you might feel you do not want to continue your life any more, like an actual life.

## Event

An event is a scene. You can see and experience in your 3D scene as your life. The scene is created only for you by AI, considering your emotion, energy and life style. They all are reflected to this game as paramters and no one knows how to create the scene because AI decide the rule creating a scene for you at that moment.

As the scene is stored in a public blockchain, anybody can experience it in the same scene, which is the only one. The cost to go into it is paid by tokens, which is minted as money on the blockchain. The way of streaming is called micropayment. You can enjoy it unless you short your token balance.

## Dice

You can step forward as you want, but the number you can proceed is deceded what tht number is in the turn. You can shack dice only one time a day. You can decide which direction you would go but the number of dice contains randomness which can be called "destiny" in real life.

## Voice Diary

The trigger you start stepping is a voice diary. You can record your daily memory by speaking to your device in which the application are working. The voice contains your emotion and what you did today, true or false, and decomposed as some paramters. The record is stored in a blockchain, with a generative art token.
