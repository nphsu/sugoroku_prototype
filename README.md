## Abstraction

This is not only a motivation game but also a mirror of your life. Everyone has a goal, even though it is a tiny goal for others, and some one can make an effort for it but others can't for some reasons.
You should visualize your steps by recoding your daily lives as a sugoroku, to be able to achieve something special for yourself.

## Why we need

Nowadays, as we humans are improving significantly by technology, there is a dramatically change in comparison with a few dacades ago. Fortunately, the disparity of information is almost equal to zero due to Smartphone and Internet. However, that of motivation is still remain, and the impact for our lives is getting bigger. That means those who have a high motivation tend to be successful in an area, and vice versa. We belives that this game will help those who have been struggling with having a low motivation.

## Functions

### No texting, no register

You don't need to register your personal data. If you have SNS account, you can use it.
Additionally, it is not necessary to input something in a textarea. The only thing you have to do is recording your voice which is suppose to be a comment about your feeling at the end of a day.

### Daily stamp

If you did your record correctly, you will obtain a stamp which is created by Generative Art in SVG. It is also represented as a token that is stored in Substrate, which is a kind of blockchain. It can be used as an asset, as well as an art that you are the only one you have. The point is that the same one doesn't exist with two here.

### Terning Point

You can see a scene if you reach some specific places in this board. The scene is created as a memorial movie you would feel as if it is a part of your experience to be able to remember your effort a few years later.

### Punishment

If you fail to do your record in a day, a credit you have now is declined, and finally, your all assets, including stamps and scenes, are blown away. You won't be able to regain the data, as well as you won't be able to be back your time.
